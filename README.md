How to run the app:
	Open CheckoutPriceCalculator as a project. Build then run it (make sure the target device is an Android device (Optimized for Pixel 3))

	Once in the app, you may browse the virtual store and pick the items you want to purchase by clicking the "+" button below the item's name. That will add one unit of this item to your shopping cart. Similarly, clicking the "-" button below the item's name will remove one unit of this item from your shopping cart.

	Once you are satisfied with the contents of your cart, click the "Checkout" button to proceed to the second page where you will confirm your purchase.

	Click the "ADD TAX" and "ADD DISCOUNT" buttons to set the tax and input the voucher codes respectively. Note that the tax must be an int and the voucher code a string.

	After that, review your cart of items as well as the price. If you would like to go back and change the contents of the cart, clicking the back button on your Android device will take you back to the first page where you can change the contents of your cart again.

	Once you finalized the contents of the cart and are ready to pay, click the "CONFIRM CHECKOUT" button and an alert will pop-up informing you of a successful transaction.


NOTE: For the discount, please input any one of these 4 strings for it to actually work, without the quotation marks.
"HELLOPROFS&TAS", "PLSGIVEUS100PERCENT", "SMILEYFACE", "HAVEANICEDAY"

One last note: If you want to input your own items, then please put the logo of the images in the "drawable" folder on Android Studio, and change its name and everything in row_item.xml, etc.


Happy shopping :)!
